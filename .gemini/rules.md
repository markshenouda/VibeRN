# Gemini Rules for VibeRN

> **Primary Reference:** See [AI_INSTRUCTIONS.md](../AI_INSTRUCTIONS.md) for comprehensive AI agent guidelines.

## Gemini-Specific Notes

- Write strongly-typed TypeScript code. Avoid using `any` unless absolutely necessary.
- Add code comments sparingly. Focus on _why_ something is done (complex logic, workarounds) rather than _what_ is done.
- When adding new features or fixing bugs, consider including tests.

For all other guidelines (conventions, component patterns, theme usage, etc.), refer to the master AI_INSTRUCTIONS.md file.
